/*
public interface Dog {
    void bark();
     
    void waveTail();
}
This interface specifies WHAT an object of type Dog can do, but it doesn’t tell HOW to do. The how is left for the concrete classes 
to implement, such as the Hound class in the following example:

public class Hound implements Dog {
     
    void bark() {
        // a hound barks
    }
 
    void waveTail() {
        // a houd waves tail
    }
    
    
    To summary, an interface defines common behaviors of a type without providing detailed implementation.
    It separates the WHAT from the HOW. The WHAT is strict but the HOW varies depending on actual implementations.
